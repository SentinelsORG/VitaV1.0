# RISC-V Hybrid Processor Design using Verilog

## Description

Our project aims to develop a hybrid RISC-V processor design using Verilog. It combines the power efficiency of RISC-V architecture with innovative hybrid features, enhancing performance and versatility.

## Features

- RISC-V architecture implementation with Standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Hybrid design (CISC) for improved performance
- Verilog-based development

## Implemented Modules

- **Program Counter**: Manages the address of the current instruction being executed.
- **Instruction Memory**: Stores the instructions to be executed by the processor.
- **Controller**: Coordinates the control signals within the processor.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
- **ALU Controller**: Generates control signals for the ALU operations.
- **Cache Data Memory**: Serves as a cache memory for data storage.
- **Register Files**: Stores and manages register values used by the processor.
